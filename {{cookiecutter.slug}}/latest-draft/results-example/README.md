# Results "Example"

(All sentences between parenthesis can be removed eventually.)
(Replace "Example" by something more meaningful.)

## Background

(Write a short summary of the **intention** of the results, not the actual results themselves.)

## Usage

When using this as a template, make sure you update the `inputs` and `outputs` in `reprep_info`.

(Add other things worth mentioning, but not that `rr` will take care of running everythong, so
no need to explain that.)
